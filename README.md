Box Collision Game in Three.js
Overview
This project is a 3D game built using Three.js where players control a box that moves across a plane, avoiding obstacles. The game demonstrates collision detection, movement mechanics, and basic physics like gravity and velocity in a 3D space.

Features
Box Collision Detection: The player’s box collides with the ground and incoming enemy boxes.
Gravity and Movement: The player’s box is affected by gravity and can move along the X, Y, and Z axes.
Dynamic Enemy Generation: Enemy boxes spawn at a set interval and move towards the player.
Technologies Used
Three.js: For rendering 3D graphics.
JavaScript: Core logic and game loop.
HTML/CSS: Basic page structure and styling.
